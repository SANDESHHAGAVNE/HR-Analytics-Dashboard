- 📊 Monitor key HR metrics such as total employees, average salary, and attrition rate.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Analyze employee distribution by gender, age, race, citizenship, department, and marital status.
- 🏢 Identify departments and demographics with higher attrition rates.
- ❗ Examine reasons behind employee terminations for better decision-making.
- 📝 Provide detailed employee-level insights for targeted HR interventions.
